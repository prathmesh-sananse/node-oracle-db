My steps so far:

1] I set up a hosted oracle database trial account [ https://cloud.oracle.com/database ]
2] Created a Javascript app on bluemix
3] Included the Oracle NPM module in my package [ npm install oracledb --save ]
4] Needed to download the local client to my mac, needed to update path variables:
